Hello, I'm still adding projects here as I migrate them to this repository.

In this folder there are several projects that demonstrate some of my work and coding abilities.  I give a brief description of each below.

The WebProxy Server was an assignment in one of my college courses where we were given some base code to start from and created a very basic web proxy that actually works!  We worked in pairs on this project and it is written in C.

Algorithms is simply the .cs files of many algorithms we had to write in Algorithms course at UK

MemoryGame is code and program files used to make a simple memory game on Android (programmed in Java) designed in the course I took at UK for Graphics

CPlusPlus contains .cs files of a program written for an intermediate programming course I took at the University of Kentucky.

Shell was another class assignment where we given a skeleton to start from and created our own Unix Shell that performed basic functions like Unix.  I worked with a partner on this as well and it is also written in C.

Mobile Web App was my senior project, is actually a mobile friendly website, and probably one of the projects I am most proud of. It is based in Ruby, html/XML, javascript with some tools that were really powerful as well.  We were a 3-person team and actually went through SCRUM techniques developing this for an actual client.  Though Web development is not my speciality, it was a great team to work with, we worked hard to turn out a good product, and I learned a lot of new things along the way.

App Screen is a changed name of another project I wrote in C#.  This is another project I am very happy with as I had to design the screen myself.  This app runs independently of other software, only requiring .Net 4.5 framework and a network connection to connect to a database and obtain the data needed.  It has been refactored to be stripped down to very general names as well.

VB_Snippet is just a snippet of Visual Basic code that was also scrubbed down to very generic names but demonstrates VB knowledge as well.
